#### Description:
Hello! My name is Nishith P Shetty, and this is my CS50P final project. Calculator is a Python-based application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, modulus calculation, and square root calculation. It offers a simple command-line interface for users to input numbers and select the operation they want to perform.
#### Features:
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Handles division by zero gracefully with proper error handling.
- Provides functionality for exponentiation, modulus calculation, and square root calculation.
- Offers a user-friendly interface for inputting numbers and selecting operations.
#### Functions:
- **add(x, y)**: Performs addition of two numbers.
- **subtract(x, y)**: Performs subtraction of two numbers.
- **multiply(x, y)**: Performs multiplication of two numbers.
- **divide(x, y)**: Performs division of two numbers.
- **exponentiate(x, y)**: Returns the result of raising the first number to the power of the second number.
- **modulus(x, y)**: Returns the remainder when the first number is divided by the second number.
- **square_root(x)**: Returns the square root of the given number. Raises a ValueError if the number is negative.
#### Documentation:
- **add(x, y)**: Returns the sum of two numbers.
- **subtract(x, y)**: Returns the difference between two numbers.
- **multiply(x, y)**: Returns the product of two numbers.
- **divide(x, y)**: Returns the result of dividing the first number by the second number. Raises a ValueError if the second number is zero.
- **exponentiate(x, y)**: Performs exponentiation of the first number to the power of the second number.
- **modulus(x, y)**: Calculates the remainder when the first number is divided by the second number.
- **square_root(x)**: Calculates the square root of the given number.
#### How to Run:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the calculator application by executing the `project.py` file: `python project.py`
4. Follow the prompts to input numbers and select the desired operation.
5. View the test results by running pytest: `pytest test_project.py`

Enjoy using Calculator for your basic arithmetic calculations!
