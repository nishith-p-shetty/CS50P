- **subtract(x, y)**: Returns the difference between two numbers.
- **multiply(x, y)**: Returns the product of two numbers.
- **divide(x, y)**: Returns the result of dividing the first number by the second number. Raises a ValueError if the second number is zero.

#### How to Run:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the calculator application by executing the `project.py` file: `python project.py`
